It's my 4th day in web development . 

Had a small task to make a colour pallete - Spanish.

Today we focussed on CSS - styling component of a web page,the basic ones alone hopefully could make something better in coming days .


1)Make HTML file with a title, heading and colour sets. 

2)Change the label of colours to respective colours.

3)Create pallete box.

4)Make the pallete clickable with animation charecters.
